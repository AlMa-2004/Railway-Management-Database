# Railway Company Management Database

Railway Company Management database with a Flask interface for CRUD operations on entities.

## Motivation
I chose to create a database project for managing railway operations because this topic has become an important part of my weekly routine. As a frequent user of railway transport services, I have always been curious to understand what happens behind the scenes to ensure the smooth functioning of this complex system.

## Software Used

- **Database Design & Management:** MySQL Workbench  
- **Backend & Application Logic:** Python with Flask framework
